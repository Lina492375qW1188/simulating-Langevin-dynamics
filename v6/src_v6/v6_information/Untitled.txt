v3 -- version3

(After resolving the problem of compilation version on blue crab, src_laptop, src_dt2, and src_bluecrab are no longer different. As a result, the source code has been combined and separated to two different version: v2 and v3.) 

This version involves a new method called metadynamics, which contains a declaration of vector of vector storing a list of bias positions. This list is updated at every  j_bias simulation time.

Difference from v2 (without meta dynamics):
integrate.hpp/cpp
verlet.hpp/cpp
input.hpp/cpp
force.hpp/cpp
field.hpp/cpp

Output standard:
Precision of all parameters is set to be 1 except x0 and B.
In a very old version, there may be no gammay output.

v4 -- version4

In this version, the well-tempred metadynamics is implemented. A potential problem of random variables is resolved by making them static. A new variable delta_beta has been added.

Well-tempered metadynamics
verlet.hpp/cpp
input.hpp/cpp
field.hpp/cpp

# If not making r1 and r2 static, newly added variable delta_beta may change them. The other solutions are adding cout << delta_beta << endl; in input.cpp or integrate.cpp.

v5 -- version5

Output format has been eterenally changed. All positions are put before velocities.

v6 -- version6

The input style has been changed. LJ, Shifted Gaussian, and Double well have been replaced by
Potential_A, Potential_B, and Potential_C. Their corresponding parameters are (A1, A2), (B1,B2,B3), (C1,C2).
The output file name has also changed and print without including the parameters of potential.
